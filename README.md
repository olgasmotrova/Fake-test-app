## Hello i am a test app similar to instagram. Created in order to understand the principle of selecting posts and comments


Technical task:
- Feed: there is a list of all posts, each displays the author, text shortened to 50 characters, number of views, a link that leads to the post.
In the header - a link-flag to the bookmarks.
- Post: A page with detailed information about the post. The photo, post text and author card are taken from the post data. Comments are taken from a file with comments. Back link leads to home page
- Search: Search form, submitted by pressing Enter, displaying search results. 

- Posts along with information about the author and his avatar are stored in the posts.json file, comments - in comments.json. A bookmarks.json file has also been created where bookmarks can be stored.
